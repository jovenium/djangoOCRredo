# CWF 🍂 Notes

Hey!

So here is what I did during the CWF:

I have a project that is far too big for the time I had. I wanted to make a cryptocurrency trading robot (with Django).
But of course, I never used Django !!
So I used my time to learn how to use Django properly.
I started as an Academy Student, I graduate to Genin and am looking forward to be Chuunin 🍜

First week :
- description of the project, my needs and my desires 📓

Second week:
- discovery of Docker (get-started) 🐳
- diagrams of interactions/ diagrams for my little brain.

Third and fourth weeks:
- discovery of Django and deepening on several subjects.
- obtain the certification of a Django course :
